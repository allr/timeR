### This is a `variant' of  approx( method = "constant" ) :
findInterval <- function(x, vec, rightmost.closed = FALSE, all.inside = FALSE)
{
    ## Purpose: returns the indices of  x in vec;  vec[] sorted

    if(any(is.na(vec)))
	stop("'vec' contains NAs")
    if(is.unsorted(vec))
	stop("'vec' must be sorted non-decreasingly")
    .Internal(findInterval(as.double(vec), as.double(x),
                           rightmost.closed, all.inside))
