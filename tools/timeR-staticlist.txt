# This is an example file that defines which of the
# static files of timeR should be enabled in R.
# If you want to change it, it is recommended to make
# a copy and specify the name of the copy using the
# "--with-timeR-static-list=...txt" option of the
# configure script.
#
# Any text after a # is ignored

# Empty lines are ignored

# select the default timer state
default on
# if this is not specified, the default state is "off"
#default off

# Lines other than "default" specify the state for the
# timer named in that line. Currently the following
# timers are defined, the list comes from
# src/main/timeR.c, array "bin_names". Please check the
# main timeR README.md file for details about these timers.
